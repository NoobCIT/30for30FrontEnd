# 30for30FrontEnd

I'm doing the 30days30sites challenge from this: https://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites

Note that these projects are deployed to Heroku, so it takes a while to load when you open them (that's the nature of Heroku conserving resources)!

Along the way I made up my own projects or added some functionality to learn more about JavaScript.  You'll see projects using API's, incorporating Promises and Asynchronous actions as well as tests.

[Day 1: Portfolio](https://desolate-tor-91462.herokuapp.com/)

Just a made up portfolio page.  Never knew letter spacing and line height could make such a difference.

[Day 2: Event Invitation](https://thawing-headland-76532.herokuapp.com/)

Made up a wedding invitation.

[Day 3: Tourist Attraction](https://pacific-bayou-48745.herokuapp.com/)

Got to play around with making an image slider.  The slider works,
but for some reason is a little buggy when it comes to normal layout vs mobile layout.  You have to refresh if you resize the screen from one to the other or vice versa.

[Day 4: Products](https://tranquil-crag-77456.herokuapp.com/)

Started to learn CSS Grid.  I noticed CSS Grid can be a little buggy in Chrome based off my experiences and readings.  The site works fine in Firefox, but is a little buggy in Chrome.

[Day 5: Restaurant](https://thawing-plateau-40704.herokuapp.com/)

I think I'm starting to like flexbox more.  Decided to start something new going back to flexbox.

[Day 6: Author](https://secure-plateau-31217.herokuapp.com/)

Learned to make a drop down menu.

[Day 7: Movie](https://warm-fortress-43025.herokuapp.com/)

Learned to embed video clips.

[Day 8: TicTacToe](https://salty-inlet-59965.herokuapp.com/)

Focused on functionality and just the basics to play.

[Day 9: Todo](https://desolate-river-50809.herokuapp.com/)

Made a todo list to practice more JavaScript!

[Day 10: Photographer](https://agile-reaches-84934.herokuapp.com/)

A beautiful site for a photographer.

[Day 11: Services](https://fierce-hollows-50893.herokuapp.com/)

Another beautiful site for service type applications.

[Day 12: FoodAPI](https://fathomless-earth-74107.herokuapp.com/)

Used the Zomato API to make my own 'Yelp' of food listings for San Francisco!

[Day 13: PokemonAPI](https://radiant-waters-39870.herokuapp.com/)

Used the Pokemon API to learn more about promises, asynchronous actions, and how to make multiple fetch calls and handle their responses.  This tutorial shows how to use all those techniques:
