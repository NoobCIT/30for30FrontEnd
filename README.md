# 30for30FrontEnd

I'm doing the 30days30sites challenge from this: https://www.subscribepage.com/30days30sites

[Day 1: Portfolio](https://desolate-tor-91462.herokuapp.com/)

Just a made up portfolio page.  Never knew letter spacing and line height could make such a difference.

[Day 2: Event Invitation](https://thawing-headland-76532.herokuapp.com/)

Made up a wedding invitation.

[Day 3: Tourist Attraction](https://pacific-bayou-48745.herokuapp.com/)

Got to play around with making an image slider.  The slider works,
but for some reason is a little buggy when it comes to normal layout vs mobile layout.  You have to refresh if you resize the screen from one to the other or vice versa.
